# FiveDollarFlip

This website is a demonstration of my favorite question from a Georgia Tech probability class.

Here's the game: 
You pay 5 dollars to play. 
At any "tails", the game is over. 
The first "heads" gives you $1 back.
The second "heads" gives you $2 back.
The third "heads" gives you $4 back.
Then $8, etc. 

Are the odds in your favor? Let's find out!
